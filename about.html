        History of printing
      </h1>

      <p>
        he history of printing starts as early as 3500 BCE, when the proto-Elamite and Sumerian civilizations used
        cylinder seals to certify documents written in clay. Other early forms include block seals, hammered coinage,
        pottery imprints, and cloth printing. Initially a method of printing patterns on cloth such as silk, woodblock
        printing for texts on paper originated in China by the 7th century during the Tang dynasty, leading to the
        spread
        of book production and woodblock printing in other parts of Asia such as Korea and Japan. The Chinese Buddhist
        Diamond Sutra, printed by woodblock on 11 May 868, is the earliest known printed book with a precise publishing
        date. Movable type was invented by Chinese artisan Bi Sheng in the 11th century during the Song dynasty, but it
        received limited use compared to woodblock printing. Nevertheless, the technology spread outside China, as the
        oldest printed book using metal movable type was the Jikji, printed in Korea in 1377 during the Goryeo era.

        Woodblock printing was also used in Europe until the mid-15th century. Late medieval German inventor Johannes
        Gutenberg created the first printing press based on previously known mechanical presses and a process for
        mass-producing metal type. By the end of the 15th century his invention and widescale circulation of the
        Gutenberg
        Bible became responsible for a burgeoning economical book publishing industry across Renaissance Europe and
        eventually among the colonial publishers and printers that emerged in the British-American colonies. This
        industry
        enabled the communication of ideas and sharing of knowledge on an unprecedented scale, leading to the global
        spread of the printing press during the early modern period. Alongside the development of text printing, new and
        lower-cost methods of image reproduction were developed, including lithography, screen printing and
        photocopying.
